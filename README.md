# **Project Title**
**COVID-19 and Mental Health in the United States**

***

# **Introduction**
[cite_start]This project investigates the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths with reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in the United States[cite: 3]. [cite_start]It merges publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases/deaths and mental health surveys to examine trends, state-level disparities, and the impact of the vaccine rollout on the population's mental health[cite: 4].

***

# **Methodology**
[cite_start]The analysis used two main datasets: a weekly COVID-19 case and death dataset and an anxiety and depression survey dataset[cite: 11]. [cite_start]Preprocessing steps included cleaning numeric values, harmonizing state names, and aligning the time periods of the two datasets[cite: 12]. [cite_start]The analyses performed included scatterplots, trend lines, heatmaps, and statistical measures such as correlations and averages[cite: 14].

# **Key Findings**
The study revealed several key insights:

* [cite_start]**Relationship to COVID-19:** The project found a modest correlation between COVID-19 cases and mental health burden[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Scatterplots showed no strong linear relationship between COVID-19 case counts and reported symptoms of anxiety/depression[cite: 17]. [cite_start]The correlation between cases and survey values was **0.063** [cite: 137, 138][cite_start], while the correlation between deaths and survey values was **0.105**[cite: 139, 140].

* [cite_start]**Trends Over Time:** Reported symptoms of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 and showed a notable decline after the vaccine rollout in early 2021[cite: 89, 90]. [cite_start]However, the prevalence of these symptoms remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms[cite: 90].

* **State-Level Differences:** There were significant state-level differences in mental health burden. [cite_start]Southern states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma, reported consistently higher survey values [cite: 112][cite_start], while states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas reported lower averages[cite: 112].

* **Top and Bottom States:**
    * **Top 5 States (Highest Average Survey Value):**
        * [cite_start]Louisiana: 32.41 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]Mississippi: 31.76 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]Oklahoma: 31.21 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]West Virginia: 31.07 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]Nevada: 30.95 [cite: 142]
    * **Bottom 5 States (Lowest Average Survey Value):**
        * [cite_start]Nebraska: 24.91 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]North Dakota: 24.03 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]Wisconsin: 23.85 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]Minnesota: 23.34 [cite: 142]
        * [cite_start]South Dakota: 23.22 [cite: 142]

* [cite_start]**Pre- and Post-Vaccine Rollout:** The average survey value decreased from **31.54** before January 2021 to **26.86** after January 2021, confirming the decline in mental health symptoms after the vaccine rollout[cite: 144, 145].

# **Conclusion**
[cite_start]The study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression across the U.S.[cite: 147]. [cite_start]While direct correlations with case counts were modest, the broader pandemic context clearly worsened mental health, with notable state-level disparities[cite: 148]. [cite_start]The post-vaccine period showed improvement, but values remained higher than historical norms[cite: 149]. [cite_start]The report suggests that policymakers should prioritize mental health interventions, especially in states with a consistently higher burden[cite: 150].
