**Project Title**

**COVID-19 and Mental Health in the United States**

**Introduction**

This project investigates the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths with reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in the United States. It merges publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases/deaths and mental health surveys to examine trends, state-level disparities, and the impact of the vaccine rollout on the population's mental health.

**Methodology**

The analysis used two main datasets: a weekly COVID-19 case and death dataset and an anxiety and depression survey dataset. Preprocessing steps included cleaning numeric values, harmonizing state names, and aligning the time periods of the two datasets. The analyses performed included scatterplots, trend lines, heatmaps, and statistical measures such as correlations and averages.

**Key Findings**

The study revealed several key insights:

Relationship to COVID-19: The project found a modest correlation between COVID-19 cases and mental health burden. Scatterplots showed no strong linear relationship between COVID-19 case counts and reported symptoms of anxiety/depression. The correlation between cases and survey values was 0.063, while the correlation between deaths and survey values was 0.105.

Trends Over Time: Reported symptoms of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 and showed a notable decline after the vaccine rollout in early 2021. However, the prevalence of these symptoms remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms.

State-Level Differences: There were significant state-level differences in mental health burden. Southern states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma, reported consistently higher survey values, while states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas reported lower averages.

**Top and Bottom States:**

Top 5 States (Highest Average Survey Value):

Louisiana: 32.41

Mississippi: 31.76

Oklahoma: 31.21

West Virginia: 31.07

Nevada: 30.95

Bottom 5 States (Lowest Average Survey Value):

Nebraska: 24.91

North Dakota: 24.03

Wisconsin: 23.85

Minnesota: 23.34

South Dakota: 23.22

Pre- and Post-Vaccine Rollout: The average survey value decreased from 31.54 before January 2021 to 26.86 after January 2021, confirming the decline in mental health symptoms after the vaccine rollout.

**Conclusion**

The study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression across the U.S. While direct correlations with case counts were modest, the broader pandemic context clearly worsened mental health, with notable state-level disparities. The post-vaccine period showed improvement, but values remained higher than historical norms. The report suggests that policymakers should prioritize mental health interventions, especially in states with a consistently higher burden.
